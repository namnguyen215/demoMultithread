Cooperative Multitasking involves well-behaved programs to voluntarily give up control back to the scheduler so that another program can run. A program or thread may give up control after a period of time has expired or if it becomes idle or logically blocked. The operating systemâ€™s scheduler has no say in how long a program or thread runs for. A malicious program can bring the entire system to a halt by busy waiting or running an infinite loop and not giving up control. The process scheduler for an operating system implementing cooperative multitasking is called a cooperative scheduler. As the name implies, the participating programs or threads are required to cooperate to make the scheduling scheme work.
