From the above discussion it should be apparent that a concurrent system need not be parallel, whereas a parallel system is indeed concurrent. Additionally, a system can be both concurrent and parallel e.g. a multitasking operating system running on a multicore machine.

Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once. Last but not the least, you'll find literature describing concurrency as a property of a program or a system whereas parallelism as a runtime behaviour of executing multiple tasks.

We end the lesson with an analogy, frequently quoted in online literature, of customers waiting in two queues to buy coffee. Single-processor concurrency is akin to alternatively serving customers from the two queues but with a single coffee machine, while parallelism is similar to serving each customer queue with a dedicated coffee machine.
